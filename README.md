Wordpress Demo
==============

This project was part of a workshop given at the University of Lethbridge on November 16, 2012. Preview it [here](http://ingadget.general-metrics.com/). Source code is available on * [Github](https://github.com/Jonesy/UlethWordpressDemo).

## Installation Instructions

The following instructions are some specific steps that compliment the [very well documented installation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress) process for Wordpress.

1. If developing locally, use a local environment setup either manually using your OS's install of Apache, PHP and MySQL, or use an application like [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html) (Mac) or [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) (Windows).
1. If working off a server, upload the contents of the `site` folder to it.
1. Import `databases/indgadet.sql` to a MySQL server.
1. Configure `site/wp-config.php` to your MySQL install.
1. To start Compass without an app, `cd ~/Sites/Workshop WP/` to project folder and run `$ compass watch --config="config/config.rb"`. This file is in a separate folder so if the project grows and has multiple configurations for Compass or any other build system, they can be tucked away here.
1. Hack away.
